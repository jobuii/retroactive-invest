# retroactive-invest
Small steps. Not sure yet. Something to help with money.

Based in London. Passionate about business, technology and investing. Idols =  Warren Buffet and Steve Jobs. Warren tought me about fundemental investing, business, money and life in general. Steve tought me the importance of really caring about what you are doing and trying to make something great.

I want to try to make a tool to use myself and hopefully others find it useful. Something that can help people invest more efficiently.
